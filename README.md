PROBLEMS
register bugs.. return what? empty open modal if username already exists (clear form) previous page if registration successful, whatever previous page was.. Make flash messages go away after flashing.   Need to confirm password before making dictionary... How?? notes p53...


Everywhere in login register and logout return render_template("base.html") it is not ok

confirm password at registration

username id twice

ADD A NEW THEME OPTION!! Javascript??

Once added, must also be selected for that quote


CODE FOR LATER

{{ url_for('add_theme') }}

_theme = {
            "theme": request.form.get("theme")
        }
