## User Stories

* A user is experiencing a certain emotion or situation and would like to read Bible verses that could help them to understand and deal with that emotion or situation.

* A user would like to see what themes Bible quotes have been added for and associated quotes for those.

* A user would like to add a bible quote that they have found particularly useful in helping them to deal with a certain emotion or situation.

* On finding quotes for a theme, a user wishes to comment on a quote that another has added.  They therefore need to register.

* A user is worried obout online abuse so is cautious about registering.

* A returning user would like to use the search by theme feature and comment on the quotes obtained as results. They need to log in to do this.

* A logged in user wants to review all the quotes they have added as they use the app as a collection for their favourites.   They would also like to see if others have commented on their quotes and have the option to reply to comments by commenting further.

* On reviewing the quotes that they have added a user thinks that they would like to update the theme they have given a quote.

* A user enters a quote then realises that they have made a mistake in the quoting of the text or attribution.

* A user recalls commenting on a quote they particularly liked and would like to look at it again.

* A user looking at their recent commenting activity sees a spelling mistake in one of their comments and would like to correct it.

* One of a user's comments has received negaive comments back.   They have thought about it again and now wish to delete their comment.

* A user no longer wants to use the app and wishes to delete the quotes they have added.

* Admin needs a page where they can monitor all site activity and delete false quotes, correct errors in quotes where possible and monitor comments for breaches of site standards, with the functionality to delete comments if necessary.   



## UX

### **1. Strategy**

To create a web abb that gives the user an interface to meet the needs of the user stories, connected to a MongoDB database. This will store all the quotes added and associated information so that it can be accessed (Read), added to (Created), edited (Updated) or removed (Deleted).  In this way this project will meet its CRUD requirements.

### **2. Scope**

Features to include:

* Navbar with a Brand Logo and links for Home, Login and Register for the unlogged in user and Home, Add a Quote, My Quotes, My Comments and Logout for a logged in user.  There will be an extra link, ADMIN, for users logged in as admin.  

* Login and Register links which will open modals for login or register criteria to be entered and submitted. 

* Search bar on the homepage which enables users to seach for quotes for a chosen theme by typing that theme into the search bar.

* Search results page showing quotes stored in the database for the searched for theme.  Each quote will be on a card panel which is a collapsible header, showing the book chapter and verses from the bible, the theme the quote is for, the quote text, which user added the quote and a caret down icon labelled comments. The collapsible body will show the comments about the quote, each on a card panel with which user made the comment. Below the comments cards but still in the collapsible body for each quote, if the user is logged in there will be a card to make and post a comment for that quote. If they are not logged in there will ba a message saying login or register to make a comment.  If there are no quotes for the searched theme there will be a message saying so and an option either to log in/register to add a quote or add a quote if already logged in.

* Description of app and instructions for using it on the Homepage.

* Dropdown to show all the themes for which there are already quotes.  Each theme clickable to redirect to a page rendering those quotes. This page will be indistuiguishable in structure from the search results page from the user's perspective.

* There will be 4 navigable pages for the logged in user, Home, Add A Quote, My Quotes and My Comments.  An aditional 5th, ADMIN, will be navigable fo a user logged in as admin. 

* There will be an Add Quote page where users enter the details of a quote they would like to add: Theme, Book, Chapter, Start Verse, End Verse (optional) and quote Text. There is a lage Add Quote button at the bottom which will submit the quote to the database as an object.

* My Quotes page to show the user all the quotes that they have added. Same structure as Search results page but each quote will have edit and delete buttons on the top right of each quote card.

* The delete buttons on the MyQuotes page will open a modal asking the user to confirm the quote delete before deleting it from the database.

* The Edit buttons on the my quotes page will navigate to an edit quote page which looks the same as the add quote page but will be prepoulated with values for the quote being edited. There will be an option here to cancel the edit, which will return to the My Quotes page.

* There will be a My Comments page listing the quotes on which a user has commented.  All the comments





### **3. Structure**

* The app will be over 8 html templates extending a base template.  

* It will be responsive for different screen sizes and the layout will vary accordingly.  
* The header will contain the colour scheme selection options, page title, the date and time and the How To Use speech bubble button to open the modal. 
* Below the header, a section containing a text input field to name the list OR the title of the currently open list.  
* The weather API will be to the left of the screen on a desktop and in the bottom section of the page on a tablet and a mobile.
* The to do list items will be displayed centrally on the screen with a 'done' checkbox to the left and urgent and trash button icons to the right of each item. 
* The 'enter a to-do' text input will be central at the bottom of the page on a desktop or at the bottom of the 'to dos' section on a tablet or mobile.
* List titles will display in a column to the right of the screen on desktop and between the todos and the weather on a mobile or tablet.

### **4. Skeleton**

The wireframes can be viewed here:

- [Wireframes](assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)


### **5. Surface**

There will be 4 different themes to choose from each with its own colour scheme. There will be a font for the business themes and a font for the fun themes.  The 4 themes will be:

* Business light:
    * A pleasant but non distracting theme with a mainly white background.

* Business dark:
    * A pleasant but non distracting theme with a dark coloured background and white text in contrast.

* Fun light:
    * A vibrant and exciting rainbow theme to encourage the user to find getting things done 'fun'.

* Fun dark:
    * An artistic and attractive dark coloured theme aiming to lift the mood of the user without being overly bright.

## Features

### Included:

* A button bar to select an interface color scheme at the top of the page. The selection will be saved to local storage and be the theme that shows on reloading the page.

* The date and time shown in the header.

* A speech bubble button in the header or dropping just below and overlaying the page to open a modal which gives instructions for using the app.

* An X button at the top right of the modal to close it.

* A text input field to name a list, the entered text being converted to a list title in the place of the text input on pressing enter. The entered text will also be appended to the 'list of lists' under the heading Current Lists.
* An alert box will appear warning the user of a duplicate list name if the same list name is entered twice.  The duplicate list name will not be added.

* The list name will be saved to local storage and will still be visible under the heading Current Lists on returning to the page.  

* Each list name under Current Lists will be clickable to put that list name into the position of list title and show the to do items in that list in the To Do list section.  If it gets longer than the available space it will become scrollable.

* There will be a space for items to do, central to the page. On mobile this will initially be a small height but increase with added items until a maximum is reached after which the list of to do items will be scrollable.

* At the bottom of the to do items section the will be a text input field to add an item to do on entering some text and then pressing enter.

* If an attempt is made to add a to do item without a list being named, an alert will appear asking the user to first select of name a list.

* If a duplicate to do item is entered in one list an alert will appear tell the user that to do is already listed.  It won't then be added to the list.

* To the left of each item to do will be a circle that can be checked.  A checked item will then appear with a line through the text.

* To the right of an item will be an exclamation icon which can be clicked to turn itself and the text of the to do item red.  Clicking it again will remove the red color. If an item has been checked the red color is disabled.

* To the right of the urgent icon will be a trash icon which will remove the to do item from the list.

* Below the Add Something To Do input will be a New List and a Delete List button.

* The delete list will remove a list name and its to dos from the Current lists and from local storage.

* The new List button will retain the previous list name under current lists and its associated to dos will be stored in local storage.  The New List Name input box will return and replace the previous list tile.  The to dos section will be cleared.

* The current weather in the user's location will be shown in a panel to the left of the screen on desktops and on scrolling to the bottom of the app on mobiles.  A request will be made on a user's first visit for them to allow geolocation for this.

* A notification will be shown in the weather section if there is a problem with obtaining geolocation or weather data.

* All the lists, with their associated to do do's with their associated custom attributes, will be saved in local storage and be able to be reviewed on reopening the app after closing.

* The app will reopen showing the last list that was open (if there was one).


### Left to implement

* Trash icons next to each list name in the list of current lists so that a list can be deleted without the necessity of first opening it.

* An encouraging sound when a to do item is checked as done.
* A sound when a to do item is trashed.
* A 'Well Done' gif or a visual effect when a to do item is checked as done.

## **Testing**

### **Third Party Tools/Services**

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea): Used to Validate the HTML code by copying and pasting code from index.html into this webpage. 
* The HTML code passed through this with no errors or warnings.


- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator): Used to validate the code from all css files individually by pasting the code into this page.
    * The CSS code all passed with no errors or warnings.

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/): Used to validate code from all javascript files individually by pasting them into this webpage.
    * All code passed with no errors.
    * list.js and weather.js caused warnings that the code was only compatible with ES6 as template literal syntax and 'let' to declare variables had been used.  I believe these are acceptable for this project.

- [Chrome Lighthouse Extension](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/): Used to audit the app.   
    * Some improvements and changes were needed to improve lighthouse scores.  These are summarised in this table:
    ![Lighthouse Improvements](assets/images/readme-scrshts/lh-imprv.png "Lighthouse Improvements")

    * A summary of the subsequent lighthouse results are shown here:

### User Stories

Each user story was tested individually and consideration given to how it may be satisfied by this app.

* A user who struggles with keeping multiple manually written to-do lists is looking for an automated alternative on their devices.
    * The app supports multiple named lists of things to do, to which items can be easily added and removed:

    ![User Story 1](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-1.png "User Story 1 Screen shot")

* A user who is struggling with organisation wants to keep a record of tasks they need to do that can be easily updated with new items, urgent ones highlighted and finished ones checked or deleted.
    * A New item to do can be easily added by entering text into the 'Add Something To Do' text input field.
    * Urgent items can be highlighted in red by clicking the adjacent exclamation icon.
    * Completed items can be ticked off and stuck through by clicking the circle to the left of the item.

    ![User Story 2](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-2.png "User Story 2 Screen shot")

* A user who is struggling with motivation wants an attractive interface to encourage them to engage with the tasks they must perform.
    * Either of the 'fun' themes, Fun Light or Fun Dark may encourage the user to use the app.

    ![User Story 3.1](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-3.1.png "User Story 3 Screen shot 1")
    ![User Story 3.2](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-3.2.png "User Story 3 Screen shot 2")

* A user wants to be able to return to the app after closing it and review lists that they have written at an earlier date.
    * On closing the app, closing the browser, shutting down the device and then reopening it, the previously entered lists and their associated to dos will still be present as when it was closed.
    * Further organisation could be achieved by giving a list the date on which it was written as a title.  Similarly a day on which things must be done could be used as a title:

    ![User Story 4](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-4.png "User Story 4")

* A user would like to obtain information about the weather in their location at the same time as reviewing their things-to-do.
    * Provided that their browser has geolocation enabled in their browser and they allow the app to know their location on the first visit, the user can see weather information for their location on the left of the screen on larger screens and by scrolling to the bottom of the app on smaller screens.
    * Colour effects have been added to the icons if needed to make sure they all visible on all backgrounds:

    ![User Story 5.1](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-5.1.png "User Story 5 Screen shot 1")
    ![User Story 5.2](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-5.2.png "User Story 5 Screen shot 2")
    ![User Story 5.3](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-5.3.png "User Story 5 Screen shot 3")
    ![User Story 5.4](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-5.4.png "User Story 5 Screen shot 4")

* Two users wish to use the app from the same device and would like to each be able to access their own list.
    * Each person requiring a list can name it for themselves and keep their own things to do in that list, while another person using the same device can also do this.  For example:

    ![User Story 6.1](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-6.1.png "User Story 6 Screen shot 1")
    ![User Story 2.2](assets/images/readme-scrshts/us-6.2.png "User Story 6 Screen shot 2")
